"""
ML Workbench Service Optimization Package

This package provides tools for optimizing machine learning models and pipelines.

It includes:
- Model inference optimization (quantization, operator fusion, batch inference)
- Feature engineering optimization (caching, incremental computation, parallel processing)
- Model training optimization (mixed precision, gradient accumulation, distributed training)
- Model serving optimization (deployment strategies, auto-scaling, A/B testing)
- ML pipeline integration (discovery, optimization, validation, deployment)
- ML profiling and monitoring (performance profiling, metrics collection, dashboards, alerts)
- Hardware-specific optimization (GPU, TPU, FPGA, CPU)
