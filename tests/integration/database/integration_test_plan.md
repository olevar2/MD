# Database Utilities Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the plan for testing the integration of database utilities across services in the forex trading platform.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify that database utilities work correctly across different services
2. Ensure that connection pooling is shared appropriately between services
3. Validate prepared statement caching and execution across services
4. Test bulk operations in multi-service scenarios
5. Verify monitoring and metrics collection across services
6. Test resilience patterns in failure scenarios

## Test Environment

### Services to Test

The integration tests will focus on the following services:

1. **Analysis Engine Service**: Represents a compute-intensive service with complex queries
2. **Data Pipeline Service**: Represents a data-intensive service with high-volume operations
3. **Feature Store Service**: Represents a service with mixed read/write patterns
4. **Market Analysis Service**: Represents a service with read-heavy operations

### Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+ with TimescaleDB extension
2. **Redis**: For caching and distributed locks
3. **Prometheus**: For metrics collection
4. **Docker**: For containerized testing environment

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Connection Pool Sharing

#### Test Case 1.1: Basic Connection Pooling

**Objective**: Verify that connection pooling works correctly within a single service.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize a service with database connection pool
2. Execute multiple concurrent queries
3. Verify that connections are reused from the pool
4. Verify that connection metrics are collected

#### Test Case 1.2: Cross-Service Connection Pooling

**Objective**: Verify that connection pooling works correctly across multiple services.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize multiple services with database connection pools
2. Execute queries from each service concurrently
3. Verify that each service has its own connection pool
4. Verify that connection metrics are collected for each service

### 2. Prepared Statement Usage

#### Test Case 2.1: Prepared Statement Caching

**Objective**: Verify that prepared statements are cached and reused within a service.

**Steps**:
1. Execute a query with prepared statements multiple times
2. Verify that the prepared statement is cached
3. Verify that prepared statement metrics are collected

#### Test Case 2.2: Cross-Service Prepared Statement Usage

**Objective**: Verify that prepared statements work correctly across multiple services.

**Steps**:
1. Execute similar queries with prepared statements from different services
2. Verify that each service has its own prepared statement cache
3. Verify that prepared statement metrics are collected for each service

### 3. Bulk Operations

#### Test Case 3.1: Bulk Insert

**Objective**: Verify that bulk insert operations work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Perform a bulk insert operation with a large dataset
2. Verify that all data is inserted correctly
3. Verify that bulk operation metrics are collected

#### Test Case 3.2: Cross-Service Bulk Operations

**Objective**: Verify that bulk operations work correctly across multiple services.

**Steps**:
1. Perform bulk operations from different services concurrently
2. Verify that all operations complete successfully
3. Verify that bulk operation metrics are collected for each service

### 4. Failure Scenarios

#### Test Case 4.1: Database Connection Failure

**Objective**: Verify that the system handles database connection failures gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Simulate a database connection failure
2. Verify that the circuit breaker opens after multiple failures
3. Verify that retries are attempted with backoff
4. Verify that appropriate error metrics are collected

#### Test Case 4.2: Transaction Rollback

**Objective**: Verify that transactions are rolled back correctly on failure.

**Steps**:
1. Start a transaction that will fail
2. Verify that the transaction is rolled back
3. Verify that the database state is consistent
4. Verify that appropriate error metrics are collected

#### Test Case 4.3: Cache Failure

**Objective**: Verify that the system handles cache failures gracefully.

**Steps**:
1. Simulate a cache failure
2. Verify that the system falls back to the database
3. Verify that appropriate error metrics are collected

### 5. Monitoring and Metrics

#### Test Case 5.1: Query Performance Tracking

**Objective**: Verify that query performance is tracked correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Execute queries with different performance characteristics
2. Verify that query performance metrics are collected
3. Verify that slow queries are identified and logged

#### Test Case 5.2: Database Health Checks

**Objective**: Verify that database health checks work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Execute database health checks
2. Verify that health check metrics are collected
3. Simulate database issues and verify that health checks detect them

## Test Implementation

The integration tests will be implemented using the following approach:

1. **Test Framework**: pytest with asyncio support
2. **Test Fixtures**: Shared fixtures for database, services, and metrics
3. **Test Containers**: Docker containers for database and Redis
4. **Test Data**: Generated test data for realistic scenarios
5. **Test Assertions**: Comprehensive assertions for correctness and performance

## Test Execution

The integration tests will be executed in the following environments:

1. **Local Development**: For rapid iteration during development
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated testing on each commit
3. **Staging Environment**: For testing with realistic data volumes

## Test Reporting

The integration test results will be reported in the following formats:

1. **JUnit XML**: For CI/CD integration
2. **HTML Report**: For human-readable results
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: For performance metrics visualization

## Success Criteria

The integration tests will be considered successful if:

1. All test cases pass in all environments
2. Performance metrics meet or exceed the defined thresholds
3. No regressions are introduced compared to the baseline

## Test Schedule

The integration tests will be executed according to the following schedule:

1. **Day 1**: Design and implement test environment and fixtures
2. **Day 2**: Implement and execute connection pool and prepared statement tests
3. **Day 3**: Implement and execute bulk operations and failure scenario tests
4. **Day 4**: Implement and execute monitoring and metrics tests
5. **Day 5**: Analyze results, fix issues, and finalize documentation
