âœ… Implement robust Data Reconciliation processes

This commit implements a comprehensive Data Reconciliation Framework for the Forex Trading Platform, including:

1. Core framework in common-lib:
   - Base classes and interfaces for data reconciliation
   - Multiple resolution strategies (source priority, most recent, average, median, threshold-based)
   - Batch and real-time reconciliation processors
   - Comprehensive reporting utilities
   - Custom exceptions for error handling

2. Service-specific implementations:
   - Data Pipeline Service: Reconciliation for market data (OHLCV and tick data)
   - Feature Store Service: Reconciliation for feature data (versions and values)
   - ML Integration Service: Reconciliation for model data (training and inference)

3. Unit tests:
   - Tests for base classes and interfaces
   - Tests for resolution strategies

4. Documentation:
   - Comprehensive documentation with architecture overview
   - Usage examples for different scenarios
   - Integration guidelines for services

The framework supports both real-time and batch reconciliation processes, with configurable resolution strategies for handling discrepancies. It ensures feature consistency across training and inference datasets and prioritizes reconciliation for actively traded instruments.

This implementation addresses the requirements specified in the forex_platform_optimization.md file and marks the "Develop robust Data Reconciliation processes" task as completed.
