# Enhanced API Gateway Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Enhanced API Gateway for the Forex Trading Platform.

## Overview

The Enhanced API Gateway is a central entry point for all API requests to the Forex Trading Platform. It provides a unified interface for clients to interact with the platform's services.

## Components

### Core

The Core component contains core functionality for the API Gateway:

- **Authentication**: Authenticates users and services using JWT and API keys.
- **Authorization**: Authorizes users and services based on roles and permissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the rate of requests to prevent abuse.
- **Response Formatting**: Formats responses in a standardized way.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors in a standardized way.
- **Logging**: Logs requests and responses.
- **Monitoring**: Monitors backend services.

### Services

The Services component contains services for interacting with backend services:

- **Proxy Service**: Proxies requests to backend services.
- **Service Registry**: Discovers and monitors backend services.

### API

The API component contains API routes and the main application:

- **Routes**: Defines API routes.
- **Application**: Defines the main application.

### Config

The Config component contains configuration files:

- **API Gateway Configuration**: Configures the API Gateway.

### Docs

The Docs component contains documentation:

- **README**: Provides an overview of the API Gateway.
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Describes the architecture of the API Gateway.
- **API Reference**: Describes the API endpoints.

## Flow

1. A client sends a request to the API Gateway.
2. The API Gateway authenticates the client using JWT or API key.
3. The API Gateway authorizes the client based on roles and permissions.
4. The API Gateway checks if the client has exceeded rate limits.
5. The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate backend service.
6. The backend service processes the request and returns a response.
7. The API Gateway formats the response and returns it to the client.

## Authentication and Authorization

The Enhanced API Gateway supports two authentication methods:

- **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication.
- **API Key Authentication**: For service-to-service authentication.

The API Gateway implements role-based access control. Each user has one or more roles, and each role has permissions to access specific endpoints.

## Rate Limiting

The Enhanced API Gateway implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limits are configured per role and per API key.

## Request Routing

The Enhanced API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate backend services based on the request path.

## Error Handling

The Enhanced API Gateway provides standardized error responses for all errors.

## Logging and Monitoring

The Enhanced API Gateway logs all requests and responses, and monitors backend services.

## Security

The Enhanced API Gateway implements security best practices:

- **CORS**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **XSS Protection**: Protects against Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **CSRF Protection**: Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Security Headers**: Sets security headers to protect against various attacks.

## Deployment

The Enhanced API Gateway is deployed as a Docker container in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Scaling

The Enhanced API Gateway can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.

## Monitoring and Alerting

The Enhanced API Gateway is monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. Alerts are configured to notify administrators of issues.

## Disaster Recovery

The Enhanced API Gateway is deployed in multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. In case of a disaster, the API Gateway can be recovered from backups.

- **API Caching**: Add support for caching API responses.
- **API Throttling**: Add support for throttling API requests.
- **API Quotas**: Add support for API quotas.
- **API Keys Management**: Add support for managing API keys.
- **API Usage Plans**: Add support for API usage plans.
- **API Marketplace**: Add support for an API marketplace.
