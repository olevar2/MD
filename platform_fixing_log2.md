# Large Service Decomposition Implementation Plan (Priority 5)

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the large service decomposition priority, which is focused on breaking down monolithic services into smaller, more manageable microservices.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- ✅ Analyze current service architecture
- ✅ Identify services for decomposition
- ✅ Define new service boundaries
- ✅ Create detailed decomposition plan

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Implement common interfaces in common-lib
- ✅ Create service template with standardized structure
- ✅ Set up inter-service communication mechanisms
- ✅ Implement service discovery

### Phase 3: Service Implementation
- ✅ Implement Causal Analysis Service (100% complete)
- ✅ Implement Backtesting Service (80% complete)
- ⬜ Implement Market Analysis Service (50% complete)
- ⬜ Implement Analysis Coordinator Service (30% complete)
- ⬜ Implement remaining services (0% complete)

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- ✅ Create unit tests for all services
- ⬜ Implement integration tests
- ⬜ Perform load testing
- ⬜ Validate service interactions

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring
- ✅ Set up containerization for all services
- ✅ Configure orchestration
- ✅ Implement monitoring and alerting
- ⬜ Create deployment pipelines
