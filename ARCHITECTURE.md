# Forex Trading Platform Architecture

## Overview

The Forex Trading Platform is a comprehensive system for forex trading, analysis, and monitoring. It follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication patterns, providing a scalable, resilient, and maintainable platform for forex trading operations.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Microservice Decomposition**: The platform is decomposed into specialized microservices, each with a single responsibility.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate through events, enabling loose coupling and scalability.
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: All external requests go through an API gateway for routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
4. **Clear Layering**: Each service follows a clear layering pattern (API, business logic, data access).
5. **Standardized Service Template**: All services follow a standardized template for configuration, logging, monitoring, error handling, and database connectivity.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

Synchronous communication is used for request-response interactions where immediate feedback is required.

**Implementation**:
- RESTful APIs
- gRPC

### Asynchronous Communication

Asynchronous communication is used for event-driven interactions where decoupling is important.

**Implementation**:
- Message queues
- Event streams
- Webhooks

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker

The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by failing fast when a service is unavailable.

**Implementation**:
- Circuit breaker decorator in common-lib
- Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- Automatic recovery

### Retry

The Retry pattern handles transient failures by automatically retrying failed operations.

**Implementation**:
- Retry decorator in common-lib
- Configurable retry count and backoff strategy
- Idempotency support

### Timeout

The Timeout pattern prevents operations from hanging indefinitely.

**Implementation**:
- Timeout decorator in common-lib
- Configurable timeout duration
- Graceful cancellation

### Bulkhead

The Bulkhead pattern isolates failures to prevent them from affecting the entire system.

**Implementation**:
- Bulkhead decorator in common-lib
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Resource isolation

## Deployment

### Containerization

All services are containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

**Key Benefits**:
- Environment consistency
- Isolation
- Resource efficiency
- Scalability

### Orchestration

Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, providing automated deployment, scaling, and management.

**Key Benefits**:
- Automated deployment
- Self-healing
- Horizontal scaling
- Service discovery

### CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.

**Key Stages**:
- Code checkout
- Build
- Test
- Package
- Deploy

## Security

### Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are handled by the API Gateway and Identity Service.

**Implementation**:
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Role-based access control
- API keys for service-to-service communication

### Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

**Implementation**:
