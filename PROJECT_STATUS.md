## Phase 1: Structure & Deduplication (In Progress)

**Objective:** Centralize common functionalities (Database, Security, Exceptions, Indicators, Config, Resilience, Monitoring) into shared libraries (`common-lib`, `common-js-lib`) and update services to use them. Remove duplicated code.

**Status:**

*   **High Priority (Completed):**
    *   [x] **Exception Handling:** Centralized in `common-lib.exceptions`. Services updated.
    *   [x] **Security Utilities (Python):** API Key/JWT validation centralized in `common-lib.security`. Services updated.
    *   [x] **Database Connection (Python):** Sync/Async connection logic centralized in `common-lib.database`. Services updated.
    *   [x] **Indicator Logic:** Consolidated in `feature-store-service`. `analysis-engine-service` imports from it.
    *   [x] **Security Utilities (Node.js):** API Key/JWT middleware created in `common-js-lib`. `trading-gateway-service` updated.

*   **Medium Priority (In Progress):**
    *   [x] **Configuration Management:** Unified system for common infrastructure settings (DB, Redis, API Keys, etc.) implemented in `common-lib.config`. Services updated. Service-specific config files reviewed and deemed appropriately placed.    *   [x] **Resilience Patterns:** Consolidate implementations (Circuit Breaker, Retry, etc.).
        *   [x] Circuit Breaker: Moved base implementation to `common-lib/common_lib/resilience/`.
        *   [x] Retry Logic: Enhanced with specialized database exception handling.
        *   [x] Added timeout handler and bulkhead pattern implementations.
        *   [x] Refactored multiple services to use centralized retry logic:
            *   `analysis-engine-service` clients
            *   `trading-gateway-service` broker adapters
            *   `strategy-execution-engine` risk and trading clients
        *   [x] Added comprehensive documentation:
            *   Created developer guidelines in `docs/developer/resilience_guidelines.md`
            *   Added example implementations in `examples/retry_examples.py`
            *   Enhanced README in resilience module
    *   [ ] **Monitoring & Metrics:** Extract core utilities into `common-lib`.

*   **Low Priority (Pending):**
    *   [x] **Caching Logic:** Prototype developed in feature-store-service, planned for common-lib integration.
    *   [ ] **Test Utilities:** Planning to create shared test utilities package in the testing directory.
