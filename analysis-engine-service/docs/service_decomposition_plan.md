# Analysis Engine Service Decomposition Plan

## Current Service Analysis

The analysis-engine-service currently has multiple responsibilities that should be separated into distinct services:

1. Chat Interface & API (api/api_endpoints.py)
2. Analysis Core Engine
3. ML Integration
4. Market Regime Analysis
5. Causal Analysis Integration
6. Feature Store Integration
7. Trading Signal Generation

## Proposed Service Decomposition

### 1. Chat Service (New Service)
- Move chat-related endpoints and logic
- Components to Move:
  * api/api_endpoints.py (chat endpoints)
  * chat_backend_service.py
  * chat-related models and interfaces

### 2. Core Analysis Service (Refactored analysis-engine-service)
- Focus on core analysis functionality
- Retain:
  * Core analysis algorithms
  * Basic data processing
  * Analysis result storage

### 3. ML Analysis Service (New Service)
- Handle ML model integration and execution
- Components to Move:
  * ML integration adapters
  * ML workbench integration
  * Model execution logic

### 4. Market Regime Service (New Service)
- Focus on market regime detection and analysis
- Components to Move:
  * Market regime adapters
  * Regime detection algorithms
  * Regime-based analysis

### 5. Signal Generation Service (New Service)
- Handle trading signal generation and validation
- Components to Move:
  * Signal generation logic
  * Signal validation
  * Signal distribution

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Interface Definitions
   - Define clear interfaces for each new service
   - Create shared DTOs in common-lib
   - Define service boundaries

2. Implement New Services
   - Set up new service repositories
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add necessary adapters

3. Data Migration
   - Plan data migration strategy
   - Create data migration scripts
   - Verify data integrity

4. API Updates
   - Update API Gateway routes
   - Implement new service endpoints
   - Update client libraries

5. Testing
   - Create integration tests
   - Verify service interactions
   - Performance testing

6. Deployment
   - Update deployment configurations
   - Plan staged rollout
   - Monitor service health

## Success Criteria

1. Each service has clear, single responsibility
2. All services communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. No direct database access between services
4. Improved maintainability and scalability
5. Successful integration tests
6. No degradation in system performance

## Risk Mitigation

1. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
2. Maintain backward compatibility during transition
3. Comprehensive monitoring and logging
4. Rollback procedures in place
5. Load testing before production deployment

## Timeline

1. Interface Definition & Planning: 1 week
2. New Service Implementation: 3 weeks
3. Data Migration: 1 week
4. Testing & Integration: 2 weeks
5. Deployment & Monitoring: 1 week

Total Estimated Time: 8 weeks
