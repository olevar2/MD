## API Endpoint Tests

**File**: `tests/api/test_analysis_endpoints.py`

Tests for the Analysis API endpoints using FastAPI's TestClient.

**Key Test Cases**:
- `/analyze` endpoint with valid data
- `/analyze` endpoint with validation errors
- `/analyze` endpoint with analysis errors
- `/analyze` endpoint with internal errors
- `/analyzers` endpoint for listing available analyzers
- `/analyzers/{analyzer_name}` endpoint for getting analyzer details
- `/health` endpoint for service health check
- Analysis with custom analyzer parameters
- Analysis with invalid parameters

**Test Strategy**:
- Mock the analysis service to return predefined results
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Verify response status codes and content
- Validate error response format

## Integration Tests

**File**: `tests/integration/test_service_interactions.py`

Tests for interactions between the Analysis Engine Service and other services in the platform.

**Key Test Cases**:
- Analysis with feature store integration
- Analysis with market data integration
- Handling of feature store service unavailability
- Handling of market data service unavailability
- Handling of data fetch errors
- Multi-timeframe analysis with market data integration
- Concurrent analysis requests
- Analysis with custom analyzer parameters

**Test Strategy**:
- Mock external service clients
- Simulate service errors and unavailability
- Test concurrent request handling
- Verify proper error propagation

## Test Data Strategy

The test suite uses sophisticated test data fixtures that:

1. **Simulate Different Market Conditions**:
   - Trending markets with clear directional movement
   - Ranging markets with oscillating price action
   - Volatile markets with rapid price changes
   - Support and resistance levels at key price points

2. **Provide Multi-Timeframe Data**:
   - Generated consistent data across M15, H1, and H4 timeframes
   - Ensured proper resampling between timeframes
   - Created realistic price relationships (OHLC)

3. **Include Edge Cases**:
   - Empty datasets
   - Incomplete data
   - Invalid data formats
   - Extreme market conditions

## Mock Strategy

The test suite implements strategic mocking to isolate components:

1. **External Service Mocks**:
   - Created `AsyncMock` instances for `FeatureStoreClient` and `MarketDataClient`
   - Implemented realistic mock responses for indicator and market data requests
   - Simulated service errors and unavailability

2. **Analyzer Mocks**:
   - Used patch decorators to isolate analyzer behavior
   - Created mock analysis results with realistic structure
   - Simulated analysis errors for error handling tests

## Assertion Strategy

The test suite implements comprehensive assertions that:

1. **Verify Result Structure**:
   - Validate all expected fields are present
   - Check correct data types
   - Verify nested structure integrity

2. **Validate Business Logic**:
   - Ensure regime classifications match expected values
   - Verify price levels are within realistic ranges
   - Validate correlation calculations

3. **Confirm Error Handling**:
   - Verify appropriate error types are raised
   - Check error messages contain relevant information
   - Validate error details include context-specific data

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to be run as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline. The following CI configuration is recommended:

1. **Run Tests on Pull Requests**: Ensure all tests pass before merging code changes.

2. **Run Tests on Main Branch**: Verify that the main branch always has passing tests.

3. **Generate Coverage Reports**: Track test coverage over time to identify areas needing more tests.

4. **Run Performance Tests**: Periodically run performance tests to detect performance regressions.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite provides several critical benefits:

1. **Regression Prevention**: Ensures that future code changes don't break existing functionality.

2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior.

3. **Confidence in Refactoring**: Enables safe refactoring of the codebase with immediate feedback.

4. **Quality Assurance**: Validates that the analysis engine produces correct results under various conditions.

5. **Integration Verification**: Confirms proper interaction with other platform services.

This test implementation establishes a solid foundation for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the Analysis Engine Service, a critical component in the forex trading platform's architecture.
