# API Standardization Plan

This document outlines the plan for standardizing API endpoints in the Analysis Engine Service.

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented standardized API endpoints for all domains in the Analysis Engine Service:

- **Adaptive Layer**: `/api/v1/analysis/adaptations/*`
- **Health Checks**: `/api/v1/analysis/health-checks/*`
- **Market Regime Analysis**: `/api/v1/analysis/market-regimes/*`
- **Signal Quality**: `/api/v1/analysis/signal-quality/*`
- **NLP Analysis**: `/api/v1/analysis/nlp/*`
- **Correlation Analysis**: `/api/v1/analysis/correlations/*`
- **Manipulation Detection**: `/api/v1/analysis/manipulation-detection/*`
- **Tool Effectiveness**: `/api/v1/analysis/effectiveness/*`
- **Feedback**: `/api/v1/analysis/feedback/*`
- **Monitoring**: `/api/v1/analysis/monitoring/*`
- **Causal Analysis**: `/api/v1/analysis/causal/*`
- **Backtesting**: `/api/v1/analysis/backtesting/*`

We have also created standardized clients for all these domains, following consistent patterns for resilience, error handling, and logging:

- **AdaptiveLayerClient**: Client for interacting with the Adaptive Layer API
- **MarketRegimeClient**: Client for interacting with the Market Regime API
- **SignalQualityClient**: Client for interacting with the Signal Quality API
- **NLPAnalysisClient**: Client for interacting with the NLP Analysis API
- **CorrelationAnalysisClient**: Client for interacting with the Correlation Analysis API
- **ManipulationDetectionClient**: Client for interacting with the Manipulation Detection API
- **EffectivenessClient**: Client for interacting with the Tool Effectiveness API
- **FeedbackClient**: Client for interacting with the Feedback API
- **MonitoringClient**: Client for interacting with the Monitoring API
- **CausalClient**: Client for interacting with the Causal Analysis API
- **BacktestingClient**: Client for interacting with the Backtesting API

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Standardize Analysis Engine Service Endpoints (COMPLETED ✅)

All Analysis Engine Service endpoints have been successfully standardized. Each domain now has:
- Standardized API endpoints following the `/api/v1/analysis/{domain}/*` pattern
- Standardized request/response models with proper validation
- Comprehensive error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Legacy endpoints for backward compatibility
- Standardized client libraries with resilience patterns
- See [Analysis Engine Standardization Completion Report](./STANDARDIZATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md) for details

### Phase 2: Standardize Other Services

1. **Strategy Execution Service (COMPLETED ✅)**
   - Standardized endpoints implemented following the pattern `/api/v1/{domain}/*`
   - Standardized clients created for interacting with other services
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented
   - Detailed documentation created for all endpoints
   - Health check endpoints added for monitoring service health
   - New features added for strategy performance analysis
   - See [Strategy Execution Engine Standardization Report](../../../../tools/fixing/STRATEGY_EXECUTION_ENGINE_STANDARDIZATION_REPORT.md) for details

2. **Market Data Service (PENDING)**
   - Current: Various endpoints
   - Standardized: `/api/v1/market-data/*`
   - Create standardized clients

3. **User Service (PENDING)**
   - Current: Various endpoints
   - Standardized: `/api/v1/users/*`
   - Create standardized clients

4. **Authentication Service (PENDING)**
   - Current: Various endpoints
   - Standardized: `/api/v1/auth/*`
   - Create standardized clients

### Phase 3: Update Client Code (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

1. **Identify Client Code**
   - Use the `client_code_migrator.py` script to identify client code that needs to be updated
   - Generate a report of suggested changes
   - Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED for Analysis Engine Service and Strategy Execution Engine Service

2. **Update Client Code**
   - Update client code to use the standardized clients
   - Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained
   - Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED for Analysis Engine Service and Strategy Execution Engine Service

3. **Monitor Usage**
   - Add logging to legacy endpoints to track usage
   - Create a dashboard to monitor migration progress
   - Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED for Analysis Engine Service

### Phase 4: Documentation and Training (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

1. **API Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation for all standardized endpoints
   - Include examples of using the standardized clients
   - Status: COMPLETED for Analysis Engine Service and Strategy Execution Engine Service

2. **Developer Training**
   - Conduct training sessions for developers on using the standardized APIs
   - Create tutorials and examples
   - Status: PENDING

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing standardized endpoints, follow these guidelines:

1. **URL Structure**
   - Use the pattern `/api/v1/{service}/{domain}/{resource}`
   - Use kebab-case for all URL parts

2. **HTTP Methods**
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Use consistent methods for similar operations

3. **Response Format**
   - Use consistent response formats
   - Include appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Documentation**
   - Include summary and description for all endpoints
   - Document all parameters
   - Provide examples

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain legacy endpoints for backward compatibility
   - Add deprecation notices to legacy endpoints

6. **Client Implementation**
   - Implement standardized clients for all domains
   - Include resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaking)
   - Add comprehensive logging

## Validation and Monitoring

Use the following tools to validate and monitor API standardization:

1. **API Standardization Validator**
   - Run `api_standardization_validator.py` to validate endpoints
   - Generate a report of compliant and non-compliant endpoints

2. **Client Code Migrator**
   - Run `client_code_migrator.py` to identify client code that needs to be updated
   - Generate a report of suggested changes

3. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Monitor usage of legacy vs. standardized endpoints
   - Track migration progress

## Timeline (Updated)

- **Phase 1**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Phase 2.1 (Strategy Execution Service)**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Phase 2.2 (Market Data Service)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2.3 (User Service)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2.4 (Authentication Service)**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks

Total remaining: 11 weeks
