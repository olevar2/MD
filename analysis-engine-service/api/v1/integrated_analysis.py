"""
Integrated Analysis API.

This module provides API endpoints for integrated analysis that combines data and functionality
from multiple services. It demonstrates how to use the common interfaces and adapters to interact
with other services without direct dependencies.

# The FastAPI route handlers get_market_overview and get_trading_opportunity
# have been removed as their functionality is now provided via gRPC.

# Local helper functions calculate_price_change and calculate_volume
# were only used by the deleted REST endpoints and are not needed by the
# gRPC servicer logic (as that logic is now self-contained or uses
# different data structures from adapters).
# Therefore, they are also removed.
