                results.append(future.result())

                logger.error(f"CPU-bound task failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
                results.append(e) # Or re-raise
    return results


# --- Tagging ---
# Tagging is done using pytest markers, e.g., @pytest.mark.smoke

# --- Timeout Management ---
# Timeout is typically handled by pytest-timeout plugin (configured in pytest.ini or pyproject.toml)
# Example: [tool.pytest.ini_options]
#          timeout = 300  # 5-minute timeout for all tests


# --- Async Testing Support ---
# Tests can be defined using 'async def' and use 'await'. Requires pytest-asyncio.

# Example Async Test Structure (within a test file inheriting BaseE2ETest):
# @pytest.mark.asyncio
# async def test_async_operation(self, test_context):
#     logger.info(f"Running async test: {test_context['test_name']}")
#     result1 = await some_async_function()
#     result2 = await another_async_function()
#     assert result1 and result2


logger.info("E2E Framework Core loaded.")

# Note: For full result reporting (passed/failed/skipped), pytest hooks like
# `pytest_runtest_makereport` in a conftest.py file are typically needed to
# capture the exact outcome and pass it to the TestReporter.
