"""
Implements techniques to optimize machine learning models for performance,
specifically focusing on quantization (reducing the precision of model weights)
and pruning (removing less important connections or neurons) to reduce model
size and inference time. Includes performance benchmarking tools.

Integration:
- Used by the ML model deployment pipeline.
- Imports ML models from appropriate services or model registries.
- Supports integration with inference services (like TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime).
- Part of model optimization workflows.
