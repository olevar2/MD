*   **Vision:** To build a leading-edge, AI-driven automated trading platform, specifically optimized for personal Forex trading, delivering profitable and sustainable trading outcomes through deep market understanding centered on advanced technical analysis (Gann, Fibonacci, Elliott Wave, Fractals, Pivots) combined with multi-timeframe confluence, continuous adaptation via foundational and advanced learning techniques, and robust, Forex-specific risk management. Primarily focuses on short-to-medium term trading styles (scalping, day trading, swing trading).
*   **Core Goals:**
    1.  **Deep Forex Market Insight:** Comprehensive analysis tailored to Forex (Inter-currency correlations, session liquidity, economic news impact, advanced TA).
    2.  **Accurate Short/Mid-Term Forecasting:** High-fidelity predictions relevant to Forex pairs' price action, volatility, and trends within target timeframes.
    3.  **Continuous Learning & Adaptation:** Self-evolving ML/AI models learning from Forex data, advanced TA signals, and past trading errors.
    4.  **Intelligent Forex Strategies:** Development and execution of data-driven strategies leveraging advanced TA confluence and optimized for Forex market structure.
    5.  **Efficient Forex Execution:** Minimizing costs considering spreads, swaps, and session liquidity via optimized execution and broker integration.
    6.  **Robust Forex Risk Management:** Controlling risk based on pair volatility, account size rules, and event risk specific to Forex.

    8.  **Transparency & Observability:** Providing clear visibility into system processes, decisions, performance, and tool effectiveness.

**2. Architectural Philosophy**

*   **Modularity & Services:** Decompose the system into independent, well-defined units/services communicating via clear APIs (REST/gRPC/Async Messaging - **Protocol Buffers/gRPC preferred for inter-service performance, REST for external/UI APIs**). Enforce strict boundaries.
*   **Data-Centric:** Design workflows around efficient data ingestion, processing, storage (time-series optimized), feature engineering, and consumption. Prioritize data quality and lineage.
*   **Integrated MLOps:** Embed the full machine learning model lifecycle (experiment tracking, versioning, training pipelines, validation, deployment, monitoring, retraining) as a core, automated system capability within `ml-workbench-service`.
*   **Event-Driven Aspects:** Utilize asynchronous events (via Message Queue like RabbitMQ/Kafka or internal event bus) for non-critical, decoupled communication (e.g., status updates, notifications, triggering certain batch jobs) while favoring synchronous APIs (gRPC/REST) for core request/response interactions.
*   **Testability:** Design for testability at all levels (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security). Emphasize dependency injection and clear interfaces. Automate extensively via CI/CD.
*   **Scalability:** Architect for horizontal scalability of services. Design databases and data processing for volume growth. Utilize asynchronous patterns where appropriate.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security practices (authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets management, vulnerability scanning) throughout the development lifecycle and infrastructure.
*   **Maintainability:** Prioritize clean code (enforced via linters/formatters), comprehensive documentation (code, API, architecture), modular design, and strong observability.
*   **Low Latency:** Prioritize minimizing latency in the critical data-to-order path for short-term strategies through optimized algorithms, infrastructure, and processing patterns.
*   **Self-Improving:** Design system with feedback loops and mechanisms (Tool Effectiveness, Adaptive Layer, RL, Learning from Mistakes) to enhance performance and adapt over time.

    *   **Implemented Components:**
        *   **Service Integration Architecture Implemented** - Created comprehensive documentation defining communication patterns (sync vs. async) between services, mapped service dependencies with detailed dependency diagrams, and established consistent error handling across service boundaries with standardized error response formats.
        
        *   **Service-to-Service Communication Enhancement Implemented** - Implemented robust circuit breakers between all services in `core-foundations/resilience/circuit_breaker.py` with configurable failure thresholds, automatic reset, and half-open state transitions. Created unified retry policies with exponential backoff in `core-foundations/resilience/retry_policy.py`. Established monitoring for cross-service communication with OpenTelemetry in `core-foundations/monitoring/tracing.py`.
        
        *   **Event Processing Pipeline Implemented** - Implemented Kafka-based event bus in `core-foundations/events/event_bus.py` with robust producer/consumer abstractions, message serialization/deserialization with schema validation, and integration with all major services. Created standardized event schemas in `core-foundations/events/event_schema.py` with versioning support and implemented durable event storage with configurable retention.

    *   **In Progress Components:**
        *   **TradingFeedbackCollector** (Status: Implementation not complete) - Initial implementation created in `analysis_engine/adaptive_layer/trading_feedback_collector.py` with core data models for feedback collection defined in `core-foundations/models/feedback.py`. Support for batch processing of trade outcomes and real-time feedback collection implemented. Remaining work: Integration with orchestration service and event bus, final production event handlers.

        *   **Feedback Loop Integration** (Status: Implementation not complete) - Partially implemented in `FeedbackLoop` class in `analysis_engine/adaptive_layer/feedback_loop.py` with core feedback processing pipeline connecting strategy execution results with adaptation mechanisms. Remaining work: Integration with newly created feedback components, integration of full bidirectional communication with strategy execution engine, comprehensive test coverage.

        *   **UI Prototyping** (Status: Implementation not complete) - Initial wireframes completed for Position Monitoring, Portfolio Overview, and Trading Execution screens. Core visualization components designed for price charts, position visualization, and performance metrics. Comprehensive React component library implemented in `ui-service/src/components`.

    *   **Planned Components:**
        *   **E2E Testing Framework** - Comprehensive end-to-end testing framework covering entire trading lifecycle from signal generation through execution with isolated test environments and data seeding.
        
        *   **Stress Testing Implementation** - Specialized environment for stress testing with load generation tools, market scenario generators, tests for extreme market conditions, broker connectivity stress scenarios, and internal service failure simulations.
        
        *   **Causal Inference POC** - Research and implementation of state-of-the-art causal inference techniques with experimental framework for causal discovery, evaluation methodology, and visualization components for causal graphs.
