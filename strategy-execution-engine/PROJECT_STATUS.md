# Strategy Execution Engine Status

## Current Phase
Phase 8

## Status Summary
Executes trading strategies based on signals and market data.

## Recent Updates
- Refactored `CausalEnhancedStrategy` to fetch enhanced data (including indicators) from `analysis-engine-service` via the `/api/v1/causal-visualization/enhanced-data` API endpoint.
- Removed direct dependency on `analysis-engine-service`'s `CausalDataConnector`.
- Removed direct dependency on `analysis-engine-service`'s `CausalInferenceService` by adding API client methods.
- Added API client methods for causal structure discovery, effect estimation, and counterfactual generation.
- Made service URLs configurable via ConfigurationManager and environment variables.
- Added `httpx` dependency for API calls.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Implement actual trade execution logic (currently placeholder).
- Consider adding client-side caching for causal graph results to reduce API calls.
- Implement proper error handling and fallback strategies for when the API is unavailable.
