Created a naming convention analyzer script to identify and report naming convention inconsistencies across the codebase:

1. Implemented a script that analyzes the codebase for naming convention inconsistencies and generates a report of files and directories that don't follow the standardized naming conventions.

2. Ran the script on the codebase and found significant naming convention inconsistencies:
   - 32 invalid directories (not following the standardized naming conventions)
   - 835 invalid files (not following the standardized naming conventions)
   - 1762 duplicate directories (directories with similar names but different naming conventions)

3. Generated a detailed report of the naming convention inconsistencies, which will be used to guide the refactoring efforts.

## [2023-10-19 12:00] [IMPLEMENTATION] Naming Convention Refactoring Script
Created a naming convention refactoring script to help refactor files and directories to follow the standardized naming conventions:

2. Added support for refactoring invalid directories, invalid files, and duplicate directories.

3. Implemented functions to convert names between different naming conventions (kebab-case, snake_case, PascalCase, etc.).

4. Added a dry-run option to preview changes without actually making them.

## [2023-10-19 13:00] [ANALYSIS] Naming Convention Refactoring Dry Run
Performed a dry run of the naming convention refactoring script to identify the changes that would be made:

1. Identified 32 directories that don't follow the standardized naming conventions:
   - Top-level directories like common-lib, core-foundations, and reference-servers should use snake_case instead of kebab-case
   - UI component directories like asset-detail, feedback-loop, and ml-workbench should use snake_case instead of kebab-case
   - Special directories like .github and __tests__ should be renamed to follow snake_case

2. Identified 835 files that don't follow the standardized naming conventions:
   - Python files with __init__.py should be renamed to init.py
   - JavaScript/TypeScript files with PascalCase (e.g., Button.tsx, Card.tsx) should use kebab-case
   - Configuration files with snake_case should use kebab-case
   - Documentation files with UPPER_SNAKE_CASE should use kebab-case

3. Identified potential issues with the refactoring:
   - Renaming __init__.py files to init.py would break Python imports
   - Renaming React component files from PascalCase to kebab-case would require updating imports
   - Renaming configuration files might break build scripts

4. Recommended a phased approach to refactoring:
   - Phase 1: Refactor documentation files and non-critical configuration files
   - Phase 2: Refactor directories that don't affect imports (e.g., UI component directories)
   - Phase 3: Refactor critical files with careful testing and import updates

Files analyzed:
- All files in the codebase (2656 files)

Dependencies reviewed:
- import statements in Python files
- import statements in JavaScript/TypeScript files
- configuration files
