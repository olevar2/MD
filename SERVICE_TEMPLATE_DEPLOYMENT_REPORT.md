# Service Template Deployment Report

This document summarizes the deployment of the service template to the Data Pipeline Service and ML Integration Service.

## Overview

The service template has been successfully deployed to both the Data Pipeline Service and ML Integration Service. This report documents the deployment process and the changes made to each service.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process involved the following steps:

1. **Verification**: Verified that all standardized modules exist and have the expected content
2. **Backup**: Created backups of the original modules
3. **Deployment**: Copied the standardized modules to their final locations
4. **Validation**: Validated that the deployment was successful

## Data Pipeline Service

### Deployed Modules

The following standardized modules were deployed to the Data Pipeline Service:

1. **Configuration Management**: 
   - Source: `data_pipeline_service/config/standardized_config.py`
   - Destination: `data_pipeline_service/config/config.py`
   - Backup: `data_pipeline_service/config/config.py.bak.20250512172628`

2. **Logging Setup**: 
   - Source: `data_pipeline_service/logging_setup_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `data_pipeline_service/logging_setup.py`
   - Backup: `data_pipeline_service/logging_setup.py.bak.20250512172628`

3. **Service Clients**: 
   - Source: `data_pipeline_service/service_clients_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `data_pipeline_service/service_clients.py`
   - Backup: `data_pipeline_service/service_clients.py.bak.20250512172628`

4. **Database Connectivity**: 
   - Source: `data_pipeline_service/database_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `data_pipeline_service/database.py`
   - Backup: `data_pipeline_service/database.py.bak.20250512172628`

5. **Error Handling**: 
   - Source: `data_pipeline_service/error_handling_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `data_pipeline_service/error_handling.py`
   - Backup: `data_pipeline_service/error_handling.py.bak.20250512172628`

### Validation

The deployment was validated by:

1. Verifying that all standardized modules were copied to their final locations
2. Verifying that backups were created for all original modules
3. Checking that the test file exists

## ML Integration Service

### Deployed Modules

The following standardized modules were deployed to the ML Integration Service:

1. **Configuration Management**: 
   - Source: `ml_integration_service/config/standardized_config.py`
   - Destination: `ml_integration_service/config/config.py`
   - Note: No backup was created as the original file did not exist

2. **Logging Setup**: 
   - Source: `ml_integration_service/logging_setup_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `ml_integration_service/logging_setup.py`
   - Note: No backup was created as the original file did not exist

3. **Service Clients**: 
   - Source: `ml_integration_service/service_clients_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `ml_integration_service/service_clients.py`
   - Note: No backup was created as the original file did not exist

4. **Error Handling**: 
   - Source: `ml_integration_service/error_handling_standardized.py`
   - Destination: `ml_integration_service/error_handling.py`
   - Note: No backup was created as the original file did not exist

### Validation

The deployment was validated by:

1. Verifying that all standardized modules were copied to their final locations
2. Checking that the test file exists

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the Services**: Monitor the services to ensure they work correctly with the standardized modules
2. **Update Documentation**: Update the service documentation to reflect the new standardized structure
3. **Implement ML Workbench Service Migration**: Follow the migration plan to create standardized modules for the ML Workbench Service
4. **Implement Monitoring Alerting Service Migration**: Follow the migration plan to create standardized modules for the Monitoring Alerting Service

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with the deployed standardized modules, follow these steps to roll back:

1. **Data Pipeline Service**:
   - Restore the backup files:
     - `data_pipeline_service/config/config.py.bak.20250512172628` → `data_pipeline_service/config/config.py`
     - `data_pipeline_service/logging_setup.py.bak.20250512172628` → `data_pipeline_service/logging_setup.py`
     - `data_pipeline_service/service_clients.py.bak.20250512172628` → `data_pipeline_service/service_clients.py`
     - `data_pipeline_service/database.py.bak.20250512172628` → `data_pipeline_service/database.py`
     - `data_pipeline_service/error_handling.py.bak.20250512172628` → `data_pipeline_service/error_handling.py`

2. **ML Integration Service**:
   - Remove the deployed files:
     - `ml_integration_service/config/config.py`
     - `ml_integration_service/logging_setup.py`
     - `ml_integration_service/service_clients.py`
     - `ml_integration_service/error_handling.py`
