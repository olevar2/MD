/tool sequential-thinking thought="I need to analyze the forex trading platform codebase" thoughtNumber=1 totalThoughts=5 nextThoughtNeeded=true

If the Sequential Thinking MCP server is working correctly, you should see a response with a structured thinking process, including:
- Current step description
- Recommended tools

Try following up with a second thought:

/tool sequential-thinking thought="Let's examine the architecture and dependencies" thoughtNumber=2 totalThoughts=5 nextThoughtNeeded=true
