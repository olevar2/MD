To test the Desktop Commander MCP server, copy and paste the following command into Claude Desktop:

/tool desktop-commander execute_command {"command": "dir", "timeout": 5000}

If the Desktop Commander MCP server is working correctly, you should see a response with the directory listing.

You can also try a more complex command:

/tool desktop-commander list_directory {"path": "D:\\MD\\forex_trading_platform"}

This should return a detailed listing of files and directories in your forex trading platform directory.

To test file reading capabilities:

/tool desktop-commander read_file {"path": "D:\\MD\\forex_trading_platform\\tools\\fixing\\forex_platform_optimization.md"}
