To test the Memory MCP server, copy and paste the following command into Claude Desktop:

/tool mem0-memory-mcp store {"key": "test_memory", "value": "This is a test of the Memory MCP server for the forex trading platform."}

If the Memory MCP server is working correctly, you should see a confirmation that the memory was stored.

Now try retrieving the memory:

/tool mem0-memory-mcp recall {"key": "test_memory"}

You should see the text you stored earlier.

To test storing more complex information:

/tool mem0-memory-mcp store {"key": "forex_platform_phase", "value": "Currently working on Phase 2: Comprehensive Error Handling and Resilience (High Priority)"}
