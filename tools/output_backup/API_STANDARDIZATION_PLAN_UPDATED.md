## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing standardized endpoints, follow these guidelines:

1. **URL Structure**
   - Use the pattern `/api/v1/{service}/{domain}/{resource}`
   - Use kebab-case for all URL parts

2. **HTTP Methods**
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Use consistent methods for similar operations

3. **Response Format**
   - Use consistent response formats
   - Include appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Documentation**
   - Include summary and description for all endpoints
   - Document all parameters
   - Provide examples

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain legacy endpoints for backward compatibility
   - Add deprecation notices to legacy endpoints

6. **Client Implementation**
   - Implement standardized clients for all domains
   - Include resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaking)
   - Add comprehensive logging

## Validation and Monitoring

Use the following tools to validate and monitor API standardization:

1. **API Standardization Validator**
   - Run `api_standardization_validator.py` to validate endpoints
   - Generate a report of compliant and non-compliant endpoints

2. **Client Code Migrator**
   - Run `client_code_migrator.py` to identify client code that needs to be updated
   - Generate a report of suggested changes

3. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Monitor usage of legacy vs. standardized endpoints
   - Track migration progress

## Timeline (Updated)

- **Phase 1**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Phase 2.1**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Phase 2.2**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2.3**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 2.4**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks

Total remaining: 11 weeks

## Completion Criteria

The API standardization effort will be considered complete when:

1. All services have standardized endpoints following the guidelines
2. All client code has been updated to use the standardized clients
3. Comprehensive documentation is available for all standardized endpoints
4. Developer training has been conducted
5. Usage monitoring shows that legacy endpoints are no longer being used

## Conclusion

The API standardization effort is progressing well, with the Analysis Engine Service and Strategy Execution Engine Service now fully standardized. The next steps are to standardize the remaining services, update client code, and complete the documentation and training.

This updated plan reflects the current status and outlines the remaining work to be done to achieve a fully standardized API surface across the Forex Trading Platform.
