# Architecture Review Process

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture review process for significant changes to the Forex Trading Platform.

## When is Review Required?

Reviews are required for:

1. New services or removal of services
2. Changes to service interfaces in common-lib
3. Changes to event schemas or communication patterns
4. Changes affecting multiple services
5. Performance-critical changes

## Review Process

### 1. Pre-Review

#### Documentation Required
- Architecture Decision Record (if applicable)
- Technical design document
- Impact analysis
- Migration plan
- Test strategy

#### Analysis Required
- Dependency analysis
- Performance impact
- Security implications
- Operational impact

### 2. Review Meeting

#### Participants
- Lead Architect
- Service Owner(s)
- Tech Lead(s)
- Senior Engineers
- DevOps Representative

#### Meeting Format
1. Design presentation (15 mins)
2. Technical deep dive (30 mins)
3. Questions and discussion (30 mins)
4. Action items and next steps (15 mins)

### 3. Review Criteria

#### Architecture Alignment
- [ ] Follows service isolation principles
- [ ] Uses established communication patterns
- [ ] Maintains clear service boundaries
- [ ] Implements proper error handling
- [ ] Includes monitoring and observability

#### Technical Requirements
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Clear interface contracts
- [ ] Proper event schemas
- [ ] Adequate test coverage
- [ ] Performance within SLAs

#### Operational Requirements
- [ ] Deployment strategy defined
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Capacity planning completed
- [ ] Security review conducted

### 4. Post-Review

#### Deliverables
1. Approved design document
2. Updated architecture documentation
3. Implementation plan
4. Test and validation plan
5. Rollout strategy

#### Follow-up
- Weekly progress updates
- Technical oversight during implementation
- Post-implementation review
- Metrics validation
- Documentation updates

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Service Communication
```python
# Use interfaces from common-lib
from common_lib.interfaces import IServiceAdapter

# Implement adapters in services
class ServiceAdapter(IServiceAdapter):
    async def handle_request(self, req: Request) -> Response:
        # Implementation
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
# Use standard error patterns
from common_lib.errors import ServiceError

try:
    result = await service.process()
except ServiceError as e:
    # Handle known errors
    metrics.record_error(e)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

### 3. Monitoring
```python
# Include standard metrics
metrics.record_latency(start_time)
metrics.record_success_rate(success)
metrics.record_error_rate(error_count)
```
