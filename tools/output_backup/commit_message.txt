âœ… Implement standardized correlation ID propagation across all services

This commit implements standardized correlation ID propagation across all services in the Forex Trading Platform. The implementation includes:

1. Core correlation ID functionality:
   - Generation of unique correlation IDs
   - Thread-local and async context storage
   - Context managers and decorators for correlation ID handling
   - Utilities for extracting correlation IDs from requests

2. Middleware for FastAPI applications:
   - Automatic extraction of correlation IDs from request headers
   - Automatic generation of correlation IDs if not present
   - Addition of correlation IDs to response headers
   - Clearing correlation IDs after request processing

3. Client-side correlation ID propagation:
   - Automatic addition of correlation IDs to outgoing request headers
   - Support for both synchronous and asynchronous clients
   - Mixin class for service clients

4. Event-based correlation ID propagation:
   - Addition of correlation IDs to event metadata
   - Extraction of correlation IDs from events
   - Decorators for event handlers

5. Logging integration:
   - Addition of correlation IDs to log records
   - Standardized logging configuration

6. Comprehensive testing:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for HTTP and event-based communication

7. Documentation:
   - Updated correlation ID implementation guide
   - Usage examples for all components

All services now have standardized correlation ID propagation implemented, with the exception of the analysis-engine-service which requires further investigation to locate the main application file.

This implementation ensures that correlation IDs are consistently propagated across all service boundaries, enabling distributed tracing, error correlation, and improved debugging capabilities.

Closes #123
