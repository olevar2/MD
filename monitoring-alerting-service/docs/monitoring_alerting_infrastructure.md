# Forex Platform Monitoring and Alerting Infrastructure

This document provides an overview of the monitoring and alerting infrastructure for the forex trading platform.

## Architecture

The monitoring and alerting infrastructure consists of the following components:

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus metrics are collected from all services.
- **Metrics Storage**: Prometheus stores metrics for short-term storage, and Thanos for long-term storage.
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards provide visualization of metrics.
- **Alerting**: AlertManager handles alert routing and notification.
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry and Tempo provide distributed tracing capabilities.
- **Log Aggregation**: Loki aggregates logs from all services.

## Components

### Metrics Collection

All services expose Prometheus metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint. The following metrics are collected:

- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Service Metrics**: Request count, error count, latency
- **Business Metrics**: Order execution time, slippage, fill rate, etc.

### Metrics Storage

Prometheus is used for short-term storage of metrics (15 days). Thanos is used for long-term storage (1 year).

### Visualization

Grafana dashboards provide visualization of metrics. The following dashboards are available:

- **System Overview**: Overview of system metrics
- **Service Dashboards**: Detailed metrics for each service
- **Business Dashboards**: Business metrics
- **SLO Dashboards**: Service Level Objectives and Indicators
- **Infrastructure Dashboard**: Infrastructure metrics

### Alerting

AlertManager handles alert routing and notification. Alerts are sent to the following channels:

- **Email**: Critical alerts are sent to the on-call team
- **Slack**: All alerts are sent to the #forex-platform-alerts channel
- **PagerDuty**: Critical alerts trigger PagerDuty incidents

### Distributed Tracing

OpenTelemetry is used for distributed tracing. Traces are collected and stored in Tempo. The following services are instrumented:

- **trading-gateway-service**
- **analysis-engine-service**
- **feature-store-service**
- **ml-integration-service**
- **strategy-execution-engine**
- **data-pipeline-service**

### Log Aggregation

Loki is used for log aggregation. Logs are collected from all services and stored for 30 days.

## Metrics

- **Memory Usage**: `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes`, `node_memory_MemFree_bytes`, etc.
- **Disk Usage**: `node_filesystem_avail_bytes`, `node_filesystem_size_bytes`, etc.
- **Network Usage**: `node_network_receive_bytes_total`, `node_network_transmit_bytes_total`, etc.

### Service Metrics

- **Request Count**: `http_requests_total`

- **High Error Budget Burn Rate**: Error budget burn rate > 6 for 6 hours

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

The following SLOs are defined for the forex trading platform:

- **Trading Gateway Availability**: 99.5% availability over 30 days
- **Trading Gateway Latency**: 95% of requests < 200ms over 30 days
- **Order Execution Success**: 99.5% success rate over 30 days
- **ML Model Inference Latency**: 95% of inferences < 100ms over 30 days
- **Strategy Execution Latency**: 95% of executions < 500ms over 30 days

## Performance Baselines

Performance baselines are established for all services. These baselines are used to set appropriate thresholds for alerts and to track performance improvements over time.

## Regular Performance Testing

Regular performance testing is performed to ensure that the platform maintains its performance characteristics over time. The following tests are performed:

- **Daily Test**: Normal load test
- **Weekly Test**: Comprehensive test (normal and high load)
- **Monthly Test**: Full test (normal, high, and peak load)

## Runbooks

Runbooks are available for common alerts and incidents. They provide step-by-step instructions for troubleshooting and resolving issues.

## Implementation

The monitoring and alerting infrastructure is implemented using the following scripts:

- **implement_distributed_tracing.py**: Implements distributed tracing across all services
- **establish_performance_baselines.py**: Establishes performance baselines for all services
- **setup_regular_performance_testing.py**: Sets up regular performance testing
- **implement_slos_slis.py**: Implements Service Level Objectives and Indicators

## Configuration
