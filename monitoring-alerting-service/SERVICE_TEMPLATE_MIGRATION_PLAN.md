# Monitoring Alerting Service Template Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Monitoring Alerting Service to the standardized service template.

## Overview

The Monitoring Alerting Service will be migrated to use the standardized service template, which includes:

1. **Configuration Management**: Standardized configuration management using Pydantic and environment variables
2. **Logging Setup**: Structured logging with JSON format, correlation IDs, and integration with distributed tracing
3. **Service Clients**: Resilient service clients with retry, circuit breaking, and monitoring
4. **Database Connectivity**: Standardized database connectivity with connection pooling and monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with custom error types and error response formatting

## Migration Steps

### 1. Analysis Phase

1. **Review Current Implementation**:
   - Analyze the current configuration management system
   - Analyze the current logging setup
   - Analyze the current service client implementation
   - Analyze the current database connectivity
   - Analyze the current error handling

2. **Identify Service-Specific Requirements**:
   - Identify monitoring-specific configuration settings
   - Identify alerting-specific logging requirements
   - Identify monitoring-specific service clients
   - Identify alerting-specific database requirements
   - Identify monitoring-specific error types

### 2. Implementation Phase

1. **Create Standardized Modules**:
   - Create `monitoring_alerting_service/config/standardized_config.py`
   - Create `monitoring_alerting_service/logging_setup_standardized.py`
   - Create `monitoring_alerting_service/service_clients_standardized.py`
   - Create `monitoring_alerting_service/database_standardized.py`
   - Create `monitoring_alerting_service/error_handling_standardized.py`

2. **Update Main Application**:
   - Update imports in `main.py` to use the standardized modules
   - Update FastAPI app initialization to use the standardized configuration
   - Update middleware to use the standardized configuration
   - Update exception handlers to use the standardized error handling
   - Update startup and shutdown events to use the standardized modules

3. **Update API Endpoints**:
   - Update imports in API endpoints to use the standardized modules
   - Add error handling decorators to API endpoints
   - Update database access to use the standardized database connectivity
   - Update service client usage to use the standardized service clients

4. **Update Monitoring Components**:
   - Update imports in monitoring components to use the standardized modules
   - Update configuration access to use the standardized configuration
   - Update logging to use the standardized logging
   - Update error handling to use the standardized error handling

5. **Update Alerting Components**:
   - Update imports in alerting components to use the standardized modules
   - Update configuration access to use the standardized configuration
   - Update logging to use the standardized logging
   - Update error handling to use the standardized error handling

### 3. Testing Phase

1. **Create Test Scripts**:
   - Create tests for the standardized configuration management
   - Create tests for the standardized logging setup
   - Create tests for the standardized service clients
   - Create tests for the standardized database connectivity
   - Create tests for the standardized error handling
   - Create tests for the updated API endpoints
   - Create tests for the updated monitoring components
   - Create tests for the updated alerting components

2. **Run Tests**:
   - Run unit tests to verify the standardized modules
   - Run integration tests to verify the integration with other services
   - Run end-to-end tests to verify the service works correctly in the full system

### 4. Deployment Phase

1. **Create Deployment Script**:
   - Create a script to deploy the standardized modules
   - Add backup functionality to preserve original files
   - Add test functionality to verify the migration

2. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Run the deployment script in the production environment
   - Monitor the service to ensure it works correctly
   - Be prepared to roll back if issues are encountered

### 5. Documentation Phase

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Create a migration summary document
   - Update the service documentation to reflect the new standardized structure
   - Create a migration guide for future migrations

2. **Train Team Members**:
   - Train team members on the standardized service template
   - Provide examples of how to use the standardized modules

## Timeline

The migration is estimated to take 2 weeks, with the following breakdown:

1. **Analysis Phase**: 2 days
2. **Implementation Phase**: 5 days
3. **Testing Phase**: 3 days
4. **Deployment Phase**: 2 days
5. **Documentation Phase**: 2 days

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Service disruption during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Perform the migration during off-hours and have a rollback plan ready

2. **Risk**: Incompatibility with existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Thoroughly test the migration before deploying to production

3. **Risk**: Performance degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor performance metrics before and after the migration

4. **Risk**: Missing service-specific requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the current implementation

5. **Risk**: Alert delivery failure during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement a temporary alert forwarding mechanism during the migration

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful if:

1. All tests pass after the migration
2. The service works correctly in the production environment
3. There is no performance degradation
4. The service uses the standardized modules consistently
5. The documentation is updated to reflect the new standardized structure
6. All alerts are delivered correctly during and after the migration
