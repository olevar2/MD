     * common-messaging: Event bus, message serialization, queue abstractions
     * common-data-models: Shared data structures and DTOs
     * common-auth: Authentication and authorization utilities
     * common-validation: Input validation and business rules
   - Implement versioning strategy for these libraries
   - Allow services to import only what they need
   ```
