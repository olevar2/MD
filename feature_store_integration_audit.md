# Feature Store Integration Audit

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive audit of indicator calculations and feature store integration across the forex trading platform.

## Indicators Inventory

### Basic Indicators
| Indicator | Current Implementation | Should Move to Feature Store | Priority |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|----------|
| SMA (Simple Moving Average) | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| EMA (Exponential Moving Average) | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| RSI (Relative Strength Index) | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| MACD | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| Bollinger Bands | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| ATR (Average True Range) | Feature Store + Direct Calculation | Yes - Centralize | High |
| Stochastic Oscillator | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |

### Advanced Indicators
| Indicator | Current Implementation | Should Move to Feature Store | Priority |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|----------|
| TEMA (Triple Exponential Moving Average) | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average) | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| Hull Moving Average | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| Ichimoku Cloud | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| Fibonacci Retracement | Analysis Engine | Yes | Medium |
| Elliott Wave | Analysis Engine | Yes | Medium |
| Gann Tools | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| Harmonic Patterns | Analysis Engine | Yes | Low |

### ML-Related Features
| Feature | Current Implementation | Should Move to Feature Store | Priority |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|----------|
| Market Regime Classification | Analysis Engine + Feature Store | Yes - Centralize | High |
| Volatility Features | Feature Store | Already Centralized | N/A |
| Correlation Features | ML Workbench | Yes | Medium |
| Sentiment Features | External Service | Yes | Low |

## Service Integration Analysis

### Analysis Engine Service
- Currently uses a mix of direct calculation and feature store retrieval
- Has its own `FeatureStoreClient` implementation
- Duplicates some indicator calculations that should be centralized

### ML Workbench Service
- Has a comprehensive `FeatureStoreClient`
- Primarily retrieves pre-calculated features
- Some feature engineering logic should be moved to feature store

### Strategy Execution Engine
- Calculates many indicators directly in strategy implementations
- No dedicated feature store client found
- High priority for integration with feature store

## Migration Recommendations

1. Create a standardized `FeatureStoreClient` to be used across all services
2. Move all basic indicator calculations to the feature store service
3. Implement caching in the client to reduce load on the feature store
4. Update strategy implementations to use the feature store client
5. Add monitoring and metrics for feature store usage

## Technical Debt Items

1. Inconsistent indicator parameter naming across services
2. Duplicate indicator calculations in multiple services
3. Lack of standardized error handling for feature retrieval
4. Inconsistent caching strategies
5. Missing documentation for some indicators
