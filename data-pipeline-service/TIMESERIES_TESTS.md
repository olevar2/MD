# TimeseriesAggregator Test Setup Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Indentation issues** in `timeseries_aggregator.py`:
   - Fixed inconsistent indentation throughout the file
   - Re-wrote the file with proper Python syntax

2. **Pandas frequency strings conversion**:
   - Added a `_convert_timeframe_to_pandas_freq` method to properly convert timeframes like "1m" to proper pandas frequency strings like "1min"
   - Modified each aggregation method to use this conversion function

3. **Added Pydantic v2 compatibility**:
   - Updated code to handle both Pydantic v1 (dict) and v2 (model_dump) methods

4. **Improved test cases**:
   - Fixed timestamp generation in test data to use fixed dates instead of current time
   - Added proper assertions for each type of aggregation

## How to Run Tests

### Using the Batch File
Double-click on `run_ts_tests.bat` to run the two tests:
- `tests/services/test_timeseries_aggregator.py`
- `tests/test_basic.py`

### From Command Line

```powershell
cd "D:\MD\forex_trading_platform\data-pipeline-service"
python -m pytest -v tests/services/test_timeseries_aggregator.py tests/test_basic.py
```

### Using Poetry

```powershell
cd "D:\MD\forex_trading_platform\data-pipeline-service"
poetry run pytest -v tests/services/test_timeseries_aggregator.py tests/test_basic.py
```

## Notes

1. The main dependency requirements are:
   - pytest
   - pandas
   - pydantic

2. The `common_lib.schemas` dependency issue appears when running all tests but doesn't affect the TimeseriesAggregator tests.

3. The TimeseriesAggregator is working correctly with all three aggregation methods:
   - Standard OHLCV
   - VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) 
   - TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)
