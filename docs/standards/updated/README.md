# Forex Trading Platform Coding Standards Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the coding standards and consistency tasks from Phase 3.2 of the Forex Trading Platform Optimization Plan.

## Implemented Tasks

1. **Comprehensive Coding Standards**
   - Created `comprehensive_coding_standards.md` with detailed standards aligned with domain language
   - Included language-specific standards for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Defined naming conventions, code style, and domain-specific patterns
   - Provided examples of correct and incorrect implementations

2. **Coding Examples**
   - Created `coding_examples.md` with concrete examples of both correct and incorrect implementations
   - Included examples for domain models, service implementations, API design, error handling, and testing
   - Provided explanations of why certain implementations are correct or incorrect

3. **Automated Linting and Formatting Tools**
   - Created configuration files for linting and formatting tools in `tools/linting/`
   - Included configurations for Black, isort, flake8, mypy, pylint, ESLint, and Prettier
   - Created a setup script to install and configure the tools
   - Implemented pre-commit hooks to enforce standards

4. **API Design Patterns**
   - Created `api_design_patterns.md` with standard patterns for API design and naming
   - Defined URL structure, HTTP methods, request/response formats, and error handling
   - Included domain-specific patterns for market data, trading, and analysis
   - Provided concrete examples of API implementations

5. **File Structure Standards**
   - Created `file_structure_standards.md` with standard file and directory structures
   - Defined structures for Python services, JavaScript/TypeScript frontend, common libraries, and tests
   - Included domain-specific examples for market data, trading, and analysis services
   - Provided migration guidelines for existing services

6. **Code Review Guidelines**
   - Created `code_review_guidelines.md` with guidelines focused on maintainability
   - Defined code review principles, process, and checklist
   - Included domain-specific review guidelines for market data, trading, and analysis
   - Provided examples of constructive feedback and code review scenarios

## Usage

### Coding Standards

The comprehensive coding standards document (`comprehensive_coding_standards.md`) should be used as a reference for all new code and refactoring of existing code. It includes:

- Domain language alignment
- Language-specific standards for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript
- Service structure standards
- Automated tools and enforcement
- Domain-specific coding patterns
- Examples of correct and incorrect implementations

### Linting and Formatting Tools

The linting and formatting tools can be set up using the `setup_linting.py` script:

```bash
cd tools/linting
python setup_linting.py
```

This will:
1. Copy configuration files to the appropriate locations
2. Install required dependencies
3. Set up pre-commit hooks

After setup, you can use the following commands:
- `black .` to format Python code
- `isort .` to sort Python imports
- `flake8` to lint Python code
- `mypy` to type check Python code
- `pylint` to perform static analysis on Python code
- `prettier --write .` to format JavaScript/TypeScript code
- `eslint --fix .` to lint JavaScript/TypeScript code
- `pre-commit run --all-files` to run all pre-commit hooks

### API Design

The API design patterns document (`api_design_patterns.md`) should be used as a reference for all new API endpoints and refactoring of existing endpoints. It includes:

- URL structure and naming conventions
- HTTP methods and CRUD operations
- Request and response formats
- Error handling
- Versioning
- Authentication and authorization
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Domain-specific patterns
- Examples

### File Structure

The file structure standards document (`file_structure_standards.md`) should be used as a reference for all new services and refactoring of existing services. It includes:

- General principles
- Python service structure
- JavaScript/TypeScript frontend structure
- Common library structure
- Test directory structure
- Documentation structure
- Configuration files
- Migration guide

### Code Reviews

The code review guidelines document (`code_review_guidelines.md`) should be used as a reference for all code reviews. It includes:

- Code review principles
- Code review process
- Code review checklist
- Domain-specific review guidelines
- Feedback guidelines
- Resolving disagreements
- Phased adoption approach
- Code review examples

## Implementation Notes

The implementation of these standards follows the guidelines from the Forex Trading Platform Optimization Plan:

- **Document standards before implementing them**: Comprehensive documentation has been created for all standards.
- **Make changes incrementally, not all at once**: The standards are designed to be adopted incrementally, with a phased approach.
- **Automate enforcement where possible**: Linting and formatting tools have been configured to automate enforcement.
- **Provide migration paths for existing code**: Migration guidelines have been included for existing services.
- **Create examples of both correct and incorrect implementations**: Examples have been provided for all standards.

## Next Steps

1. **Team Review**: Share these standards with the team for review and feedback.
2. **Training**: Conduct training sessions to ensure everyone understands the standards.
3. **Phased Adoption**: Implement the standards in phases, starting with new code and critical components.
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor adherence to the standards and collect feedback for improvement.
5. **Refinement**: Refine the standards based on feedback and lessons learned.

## Conclusion

These standards provide a solid foundation for improving code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the Forex Trading Platform. By following these standards, we can ensure that our code is aligned with domain concepts, easy to understand, and maintainable over time.
