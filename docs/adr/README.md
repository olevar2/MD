# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Forex Trading Platform.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They are a lightweight way to document the "why" behind major technical decisions.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this format:

1. **Title**: A short phrase describing the decision
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
4. **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
