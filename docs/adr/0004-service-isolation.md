# ADR-0004: Service Isolation and Dependency Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The platform had several architectural issues:

1. 12 circular dependencies between services
2. Direct imports between services
3. Inconsistent dependency management
4. Difficulty in service evolution
5. Complex testing and deployment

## Decision

We established strict service isolation principles:

### 1. Dependency Rules
1. Services can only depend on interfaces in common-lib
2. No direct imports between services
3. Event-driven communication for cross-service needs
4. Clear adapters for external dependencies

### 2. Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Common Lib    │
└─────────────────┘
        ▲
        │
┌───────┴────────┐
│    Service     │
├───────────────┐
│   Adapters    │
├───────────────┤
│   Domain      │
├───────────────┤
│Infrastructure │
└───────────────┘
```

### 3. Implementation
1. Dependency analysis in CI/CD
2. Automated checks for circular deps
3. Interface-based communication
4. Event-driven architecture

### 4. Tools
1. analyze_dependencies.py
2. check_circular_deps.py
3. dependency-analysis.yml workflow
4. Service boundary validations

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Clear service boundaries
2. Easier service evolution
3. Simplified testing
4. Better deployment isolation
5. Reduced coupling

### Negative
1. More boilerplate code
2. Additional development overhead
3. More complex initial setup
4. Learning curve for teams
5. Infrastructure needs

## Technical Implementation

### 1. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
jobs:
  analyze:
    steps:
      - Analyze dependencies
      - Check for cycles
      - Generate reports
      - Block on violations
```

### 2. Tooling
- Dependency graph analysis
- Cycle detection
- Impact analysis
- Boundary validation

### 3. Monitoring
- Dependency metrics
- Service coupling analysis
- Performance impact tracking
- Evolution patterns

## Validation Criteria

1. Zero circular dependencies
2. Clear interface contracts
3. Isolated deployments
4. Independent testing
5. Maintainable codebase

## Enforcement

### 1. CI/CD Checks
- Block merges with cycles
- Require interface updates
- Validate boundaries
- Check event schemas

### 2. Code Review
- Architecture review process
- Dependency impact analysis
- Interface evolution review
- Breaking change detection

### 3. Monitoring
- Track service coupling
- Measure change impact
- Monitor event patterns
- Analyze dependencies
