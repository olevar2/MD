# API Standards

## API Design Principles
- Use RESTful conventions for HTTP APIs
- Use gRPC for high-performance internal service communication
- Follow semantic versioning (v1, v2, etc.)
- Use OAuth2/JWT for authentication
- Implement rate limiting and quota management

## Request/Response Standards
- Use standard HTTP status codes
- Include request ID in all responses for tracing
- Implement consistent error response format
- Support pagination for list endpoints
- Support field filtering and selection

## Security Standards
- Require TLS 1.3+
- Implement API key rotation
- Use refresh tokens with short-lived access tokens
- Implement CORS policies
- Rate limiting per client/endpoint

## Monitoring Standards
- Track response times
- Monitor error rates
- Track API version usage
- Monitor rate limit hits
- Track authentication failures

## Documentation Standards
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
- Use Protocol Buffers for gRPC services
- Include example requests/responses
- Document all error scenarios
- Maintain changelog for each version
