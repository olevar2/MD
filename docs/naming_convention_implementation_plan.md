# Naming Convention Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for standardizing naming conventions across the Forex Trading Platform codebase. The goal is to establish consistent naming patterns across the codebase to improve maintainability, readability, and reduce confusion.

## Current State

Based on the naming convention analysis, we have identified:

- 32 directories that don't follow the standardized naming conventions
- 835 files that don't follow the standardized naming conventions
- 1762 duplicate directories (directories with similar names but different naming conventions)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation and Non-Critical Files (Week 1)

**Objective**: Refactor documentation files and non-critical configuration files that don't affect the functionality of the platform.

**Tasks**:

1. Refactor documentation files:
   - Rename UPPER_SNAKE_CASE documentation files to kebab-case (e.g., API_DOCS.md → api-docs.md)
   - Rename snake_case documentation files to kebab-case (e.g., api_standardization_report.json → api-standardization-report.json)

2. Refactor non-critical configuration files:
   - Rename configuration files that aren't directly referenced in code (e.g., .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc.json)

3. Update references to these files in documentation and README files

**Risks**:
- Low risk as these files don't affect the functionality of the platform
- May require updates to documentation links

### Phase 2: Directory Structure (Week 2-3)

**Objective**: Refactor directories that don't affect imports or require minimal import updates.

**Tasks**:

1. Refactor UI component directories:
   - Rename kebab-case directories to snake_case (e.g., asset-detail → asset_detail)
   - Update import statements in files that reference these directories

2. Refactor test directories:
   - Rename __tests__ directories to tests
   - Update import statements and test configurations

3. Create symbolic links or aliases for renamed directories to maintain backward compatibility

**Risks**:
- Medium risk as these changes may affect imports and require updates to build configurations
- May require updates to test configurations and CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 3: Critical Files (Week 4-6)

**Objective**: Refactor critical files that require careful testing and import updates.

**Tasks**:

1. Refactor JavaScript/TypeScript files:
   - Rename PascalCase component files to kebab-case (e.g., Button.tsx → button.tsx)
   - Update import statements in files that reference these components
   - Update build configurations and webpack aliases

2. Refactor Python files:
   - DO NOT rename __init__.py files as this would break Python imports
   - Rename other Python files to follow snake_case consistently

3. Refactor service files:
   - Rename camelCase service files to kebab-case (e.g., analysisService.ts → analysis-service.ts)
   - Update import statements and service registrations

**Risks**:
- High risk as these changes affect core functionality
- Requires comprehensive testing to ensure no functionality is broken
- May require updates to build configurations and deployment scripts

### Phase 4: Duplicate Directories (Week 7-8)

**Objective**: Consolidate duplicate directories to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability.

**Tasks**:

1. Identify duplicate functionality between directories with similar names
2. Merge functionality into a single directory following the standardized naming conventions
3. Create symbolic links or aliases for renamed directories to maintain backward compatibility
4. Update import statements and references to the consolidated directories

**Risks**:
- High risk as these changes affect core functionality and architecture
- Requires comprehensive testing to ensure no functionality is broken
- May require updates to build configurations and deployment scripts

## Implementation Approach

### Automated Refactoring

We will use the naming_convention_refactor.py script to automate the refactoring process. The script will:

1. Read the naming convention analysis report
2. Refactor files and directories based on the standardized naming conventions
3. Update import statements and references to renamed files and directories
4. Create symbolic links or aliases for renamed directories to maintain backward compatibility

### Manual Verification

After each automated refactoring step, we will:

1. Verify that the refactoring was successful
2. Run tests to ensure no functionality was broken
3. Update any references that weren't automatically updated
4. Document any issues or challenges encountered

### Testing

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure that the refactoring doesn't break any functionality:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for service interactions
3. End-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Performance tests to ensure no performance degradation

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, we will implement a rollback plan:

1. Maintain backups of all files and directories before refactoring
2. Create a rollback script that can revert the changes
3. Document the rollback process for each phase

## Success Criteria

The naming convention standardization will be considered successful when:

1. All files and directories follow the standardized naming conventions
2. All tests pass with no regressions
3. No functionality is broken
4. The codebase is more maintainable and readable

## Conclusion

Standardizing naming conventions across the Forex Trading Platform codebase is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and execution. By following this phased approach, we can minimize the risk of breaking functionality while improving the maintainability and readability of the codebase.
