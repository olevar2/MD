# Architecture Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Forex Trading Platform architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The Forex Trading Platform follows an event-driven microservice architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The platform is composed of multiple specialized services that communicate through well-defined interfaces.

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Service Isolation**: Each service has a specific responsibility and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through events to reduce coupling and improve scalability.
3. **Interface-Based Adapters**: Services use interface-based adapters to reduce circular dependencies.
4. **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all services.
5. **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retries, and bulkheads to improve system resilience.
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing.
7. **Data Reconciliation**: Mechanisms to ensure data consistency across services.

## Communication Patterns

### Service-to-Service Communication

Services communicate with each other through:

1. **Synchronous REST APIs**: For request-response interactions
2. **Asynchronous Events**: For event-driven interactions
3. **Shared Database**: For data that needs to be accessed by multiple services

### Event-Driven Architecture

The platform uses an event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication:

1. **Event Publishers**: Services publish events when state changes
2. **Event Subscribers**: Services subscribe to events they are interested in
3. **Event Broker**: Kafka or Redis is used as the event broker

## Data Architecture

Each service has its own database schema:

- **data_pipeline**: Stores market data

### Data Flow

1. **Market Data Flow**:
   - Data sources → Data Pipeline Service → Feature Store Service → Analysis Engine Service → ML Integration Service

2. **Trading Flow**:
   - Analysis Engine Service → Trading Gateway Service → Portfolio Management Service

3. **Monitoring Flow**:
   - All services → Monitoring & Alerting Service

## Resilience Patterns

The platform implements several resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by failing fast
2. **Retries with Backoff**: Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
3. **Bulkheads**: Isolate critical operations to prevent system-wide failures
4. **Timeouts**: Set timeouts for all external operations
5. **Fallbacks**: Provide fallback mechanisms for critical operations
