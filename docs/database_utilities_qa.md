# Database Utilities Q&A

This document addresses common questions about the database utilities in the forex trading platform.

## General Questions

### What are the database utilities?

The database utilities are a set of standardized components in the common-lib package that provide optimized database access, prepared statement caching, bulk operations, and monitoring for all services in the forex trading platform.

### Why should I use the database utilities?

The database utilities provide significant performance improvements, standardized error handling, comprehensive monitoring, and resilience patterns for database operations. By using these utilities, you can achieve better performance, reliability, and observability for your service's database operations.

### How do I get started with the database utilities?

To get started, import the database utilities from the common-lib package:

```python
from common_lib.database import get_connection_pool, get_sync_db_session, get_async_db_session
```

Then, use the connection pool to get a database session:

```python
with get_sync_db_session("my_service") as session:
    # Execute database operations
    result = session.execute("SELECT 1")
    print(result.scalar())
```

### Can I use the database utilities with existing code?

Yes, the database utilities can be integrated with existing code. You can use the `apply_database_optimization.py` script to automatically apply the database utilities to an existing service:

```bash
python apply_database_optimization.py --service <service_name>
```

Alternatively, you can manually integrate the utilities by replacing direct database access with the database utilities.

## Connection Pool Questions

### How does the connection pool work?

The connection pool manages database connections for services. It creates and maintains a pool of database connections that can be reused across multiple operations, reducing the overhead of creating new connections for each operation.

### How do I configure the connection pool?

The connection pool can be configured through environment variables or by passing configuration options directly to the `get_connection_pool` function:

```python
pool = get_connection_pool(
    "my_service",
    database_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase",
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20,
    pool_timeout=30,
    pool_recycle=1800,
    echo=False,
    prepared_statement_cache_size=256,
)
```

### What is the optimal pool size?

The optimal pool size depends on the number of CPU cores and the nature of the database operations. The connection pool automatically determines the optimal pool size based on the number of CPU cores, using the formula `min(2 * cpu_count + 1, 20)`.

### How do I handle connection errors?

Connection errors are automatically handled by the connection pool with resilience patterns like circuit breakers and retries. If a connection error occurs, the connection pool will attempt to retry the operation with exponential backoff. If the error persists, the circuit breaker will open to prevent cascading failures.

## Prepared Statement Questions

### What are prepared statements?

Prepared statements are SQL statements that are compiled and cached by the database server. They improve performance by reducing the overhead of parsing and planning SQL statements for each execution. They also improve security by preventing SQL injection attacks.

### How do I use prepared statements?

You can use prepared statements with the `with_prepared_statement` decorator and the `execute_prepared_statement` function:

```python
@with_prepared_statement("my_service", "get_user")
def get_user(session, user_id):
    result = execute_prepared_statement(
        session,
        "SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = :user_id",
        {"user_id": user_id},
        "my_service",
        "get_user",
    )
    
    row = result.fetchone()
    
    if row:
        return {
            "id": row[0],
            "name": row[1],
            "email": row[2],
        }
    
    return None
```

### How does prepared statement caching work?

Prepared statements are cached in memory for reuse. When a prepared statement is executed, the cache is checked for an existing statement with the same query. If found, the cached statement is reused. If not, a new statement is created and added to the cache.

### What is the optimal cache size?

The optimal cache size depends on the number of unique queries in your service. The default cache size is 100, which is sufficient for most services. If your service has a large number of unique queries, you may want to increase the cache size.

## Bulk Operation Questions

### What are bulk operations?

Bulk operations are optimized methods for inserting, updating, or deleting multiple rows at once. They reduce network round-trips and transaction overhead by batching multiple operations into a single database call.

### How do I use bulk operations?

You can use bulk operations with the `bulk_insert`, `bulk_update`, and `bulk_delete` functions:

```python
# Bulk insert
bulk_insert(
    session,
    users_table,
    [
        {"name": "User 1", "email": "user1@example.com"},
        {"name": "User 2", "email": "user2@example.com"},
    ],
    "my_service",
)

# Bulk update
bulk_update(
    session,
    users_table,
    [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Updated User 1"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Updated User 2"},
    ],
    "id",
    "my_service",
)

# Bulk delete
bulk_delete(
    session,
    users_table,
    [1, 2],
    "id",
    "my_service",
)
```

### What is the optimal chunk size?

The optimal chunk size depends on the size of the data and the nature of the operation. The default chunk size is 1000, which is a good balance between memory usage and performance. For very large datasets, you may want to use a smaller chunk size to prevent memory issues.

### Can I use bulk operations with asyncpg?

Yes, you can use bulk operations with asyncpg using the `bulk_insert_asyncpg` function:

```python
await bulk_insert_asyncpg(
    conn,
    "users",
    ["name", "email"],
    [
        ["User 1", "user1@example.com"],
        ["User 2", "user2@example.com"],
    ],
    "my_service",
)
```

## Monitoring Questions

### What monitoring capabilities are available?

The database utilities provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities, including:

- Query performance tracking with metrics collection
- Transaction tracking
- Query analysis with execution plan inspection
- Database health checks

### How do I track query performance?

You can track query performance with the `track_query_performance` decorator:

```python
@track_query_performance("select", "users", "my_service")
def get_all_users(session):
    result = session.execute("SELECT id, name, email FROM users")
    
    return [
        {
            "id": row[0],
            "name": row[1],
            "email": row[2],
        }
        for row in result
    ]
```

### How do I analyze query execution plans?

You can analyze query execution plans with the `analyze_query` function:

```python
plan = analyze_query(
    session,
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id",
    {"user_id": 1},
    "my_service",
)
```

### How do I check database health?

You can check database health with the `check_database_health` function:

```python
health = check_database_health(
    session,
    "my_service",
)
```

## Resilience Questions

### What resilience patterns are available?

The database utilities include several resilience patterns:

- Circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
- Retry with backoff for transient failures
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Connection recycling to prevent stale connections

### How do I configure resilience patterns?

Resilience patterns are automatically applied to all database operations. You can configure them through environment variables:

```
DB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
DB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=60
DB_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
DB_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR=2
DB_RETRY_MAX_BACKOFF=30
```

### How do I handle transient failures?

Transient failures are automatically handled by the retry with backoff pattern. If a transient failure occurs, the operation will be retried with exponential backoff. If the operation succeeds on a retry, the original error is suppressed.

### How do I prevent cascading failures?

Cascading failures are automatically prevented by the circuit breaker pattern. If a service experiences a high rate of failures, the circuit breaker will open to prevent further requests from being sent to the service. After a recovery timeout, the circuit breaker will allow a limited number of requests to test if the service has recovered.

## Performance Questions
