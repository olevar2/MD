# Forex Trading Platform Architecture Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address architectural issues in the Forex Trading Platform. The plan focuses on standardizing implementations, completing the interface-based adapter pattern, enhancing resilience patterns, and ensuring consistent error handling across all services.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
1. Well-defined microservice architecture with clear service boundaries
2. Previous circular dependencies have been addressed through interface-based adapter pattern
3. Core services are properly isolated with defined responsibilities
4. Common library provides shared functionality and interfaces
5. Resilience patterns are implemented in common-lib
6. Error handling is standardized in common-lib

### Issues
1. Interface-based adapter pattern is implemented but not fully utilized across all services
2. Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, timeouts) are available but inconsistently applied
3. Error handling is standardized in common-lib but not consistently used across all services
4. Some duplicate implementations of core functionality exist across services
5. Inconsistent naming conventions exist across services (kebab-case vs snake_case)
6. Monitoring and observability are not consistently implemented
7. Configuration management varies across services
