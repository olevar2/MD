   - Implementation examples and best practices

4. **Fallback Pattern** (`docs/error_handling/patterns/fallback.md`)
   - How to provide alternative functionality when primary fails
   - Implementation examples and best practices

### Training Materials

1. **Domain-Specific Exceptions** (`docs/error_handling/training/session2_domain_exceptions.md`)
   - Second training session on creating and using domain-specific exceptions
   - Learning objectives, agenda, and key concepts
   - Code examples and exercises

2. **Resilience Patterns** (`docs/error_handling/training/session3_resilience_patterns.md`)

   - Learning objectives, agenda, and key concepts
   - Code examples and exercises

4. **Additional Exercises** (`docs/error_handling/training/exercises/`)
   - Exercise 2: Domain-Specific Exceptions
   - Exercise 3: Resilience Patterns
   - Exercise 4: Error Monitoring

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Tasks |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Complete remaining pattern documentation |
| Week 2 | Create remaining training session materials |
| Week 3 | Create remaining exercises |
| Week 4 | Review and finalize all materials |
| Week 5 | Conduct first training session |
| Week 6 | Conduct second training session |
| Week 7 | Conduct third training session |
| Week 8 | Conduct fourth training session |

## Success Criteria

The implementation of error handling documentation and training will be considered successful when:

1. All planned documentation and training materials are created
2. At least 80% of developers have completed the training sessions
3. Feedback from training sessions is positive (average rating of 4/5 or higher)
4. Error handling coverage across services improves to at least 80%
5. The number of unhandled exceptions in production decreases by at least 50%

## Maintenance Plan

To ensure the documentation and training materials remain relevant and up-to-date:

1. Review and update documentation quarterly
2. Collect feedback after each training session
3. Update materials based on feedback and platform changes
4. Conduct refresher training sessions for new team members
5. Monitor error handling metrics to identify areas for improvement
