# Error Handling Patterns

This directory contains examples and documentation for common error handling patterns used in the Forex Trading Platform.

## Available Patterns

1. [Circuit Breaker Pattern](circuit_breaker.md)
2. [Retry Pattern](retry.md)
3. [Bulkhead Pattern](bulkhead.md)
4. [Timeout Pattern](timeout.md)
5. [Fallback Pattern](fallback.md)
6. [Decorator Pattern](decorator.md)
7. [Exception Bridge Pattern](exception_bridge.md)
8. [Correlation ID Pattern](correlation_id.md)

## When to Use Each Pattern

| Pattern | Use Case | Example Scenario |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Circuit Breaker | Prevent cascading failures when calling external services | Calling broker API that might be down |
| Retry | Handle transient failures that might resolve on retry | Network glitches or temporary service unavailability |
| Bulkhead | Isolate failures to prevent system-wide impact | Separate critical trading operations from analytics |
| Timeout | Prevent operations from hanging indefinitely | Ensure market data requests complete within SLA |
| Fallback | Provide alternative functionality when primary fails | Use cached data when real-time data is unavailable |
| Decorator | Apply consistent error handling to multiple functions | Add logging and error mapping to service methods |
| Exception Bridge | Translate between error types across service boundaries | Convert database errors to domain-specific exceptions |
| Correlation ID | Track errors across service boundaries | Trace a request through multiple microservices |

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing error handling patterns:

1. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Select patterns based on the specific requirements of each component
2. **Combine Patterns**: Use multiple patterns together for comprehensive error handling
3. **Configure Appropriately**: Set appropriate thresholds, timeouts, and retry policies
4. **Test Failure Scenarios**: Verify that patterns work correctly under failure conditions
5. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Track metrics to ensure patterns are working as expected
