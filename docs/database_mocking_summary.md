# Database Mocking Infrastructure Summary

This document provides an overview of the database mocking infrastructure implemented in the forex trading platform.

## Overview

The database mocking infrastructure provides mock implementations of database utilities for testing. It allows tests to run without a real database connection, making them faster and more reliable.

## Key Components

### 1. Mock Connection Pool

The `MockDatabaseConnectionPool` class provides a mock implementation of the `DatabaseConnectionPool` class. It includes:

- Mock async and sync engines
- Mock async and sync sessions
- Mock asyncpg connection
- Mock prepared statement cache
- Methods for initializing and closing connections
- Async context managers for getting sessions and connections

### 2. Mock Database Operations

The following mock database operations are implemented:

- `mock_execute_prepared_statement`: Mock execution of a prepared statement
- `mock_bulk_insert`: Mock bulk insert operation
- `mock_bulk_update`: Mock bulk update operation
- `mock_bulk_delete`: Mock bulk delete operation
- `mock_analyze_query`: Mock query analysis
- `mock_check_database_health`: Mock database health check
- `mock_prepare_asyncpg_statement`: Mock preparation of a SQL statement for execution with asyncpg
- `mock_fetch_prepared_statement_asyncpg`: Mock fetching results from a prepared SQL statement with asyncpg

### 3. Mock Decorators

The following mock decorators are implemented:

- `mock_with_prepared_statement`: Mock decorator for prepared statements
- `mock_track_query_performance`: Mock decorator for tracking query performance
- `mock_track_transaction`: Mock decorator for tracking transactions

### 4. Improved Mock Implementation

The improved mock implementation provides a more sophisticated mock session that can parse and respond to different types of queries. It includes:

- `MockQueryParser`: Parses SQL queries and returns appropriate results
- `ImprovedMockSession`: Improved mock session for database testing
- `ImprovedMockDatabaseConnectionPool`: Improved mock implementation of DatabaseConnectionPool for testing

The improved mock implementation includes an in-memory database schema with the following tables:

- `users`: User information
- `posts`: Blog posts
- `comments`: Comments on blog posts

## Key Improvements

The following improvements have been made to the mock implementations:

1. **Fixed Mock Result Counts**:
   - Updated `mock_execute_prepared_statement` to return the correct counts for operations
   - Updated `mock_bulk_insert`, `mock_bulk_update`, and `mock_bulk_delete` to return the actual count of items processed

2. **Fixed Async Context Managers**:
   - Fixed the `async_track_transaction` function to properly support the asynchronous context manager protocol
   - Ensured that all async context managers in the mock implementations work correctly

3. **Fixed Function Signatures**:
   - Updated `check_database_health_async` to accept the correct parameters
   - Fixed the signature of other monitoring functions to match what the tests expect

4. **Added Missing Mock Functions**:
   - Implemented `prepare_asyncpg_statement` and `fetch_prepared_statement_asyncpg` in the mock implementation
   - Ensured all functions imported in tests are properly mocked

5. **Improved Mock Session Behavior**:
   - Made the mock session's execute method return results that match the query being executed
   - Implemented better query parsing to return appropriate results for different query types

6. **Created In-Memory Database Schema**:
   - Implemented a simple in-memory database schema for more realistic testing
   - Added support for defining tables and data that can be queried with consistent results

7. **Implemented Better Query Parsing**:
   - Added support for parsing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries
   - Implemented WHERE clause parsing for filtering results
   - Added support for COUNT queries

## Usage

### Basic Mock Implementation

To use the basic mock implementations in tests, set the `USE_MOCKS` flag to `True` before importing the database utilities:

```python
import common_lib.database
common_lib.database.USE_MOCKS = True

from common_lib.database import (
    get_connection_pool,
    get_sync_db_session,
    get_async_db_session,
    with_prepared_statement,
    execute_prepared_statement,
    bulk_insert,
    track_query_performance,
    track_transaction,
    analyze_query,
    check_database_health,
)
```

Alternatively, you can import the mock implementations directly:

```python
from common_lib.database.testing import (
    get_mock_connection_pool,
    get_mock_async_db_session,
    get_mock_sync_db_session,
    mock_execute_prepared_statement,
    mock_bulk_insert,
    mock_bulk_update,
    mock_bulk_delete,
    mock_track_query_performance,
    mock_track_transaction,
    mock_analyze_query,
    mock_check_database_health,
    mock_prepare_asyncpg_statement,
    mock_fetch_prepared_statement_asyncpg,
)
```

### Improved Mock Implementation

To use the improved mock implementations in tests, import them directly:

```python
from common_lib.database.improved_testing import (
    ImprovedMockSession,
    get_improved_mock_connection_pool,
    get_improved_mock_async_db_session,
    get_improved_mock_sync_db_session,
)
```

- See the `test_improved_mock_implementation.py` file for examples of how to use the improved mock implementations in tests.

## Future Improvements

1. **More Sophisticated Query Parsing**:
   - Add support for more complex SQL queries
   - Implement JOIN clause parsing
   - Add support for GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses

2. **Mock Connection Pool Improvements**:
   - Improve the mock connection pool to better handle concurrent connections
   - Add support for cross-service connections

3. **Schema Definition API**:
   - Add an API for defining custom tables and data
   - Support for defining relationships between tables

4. **Transaction Support**:
   - Add support for transactions
   - Implement rollback functionality
