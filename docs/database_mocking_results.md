# Database Mocking Results

## What Works (5 passing tests)

1. **test_prepared_statement_cache** - The prepared statement cache is working correctly with mocks.
2. **test_connection_pool_initialization** - The connection pool initialization is working correctly with mocks.
3. **test_query_performance_tracking** - The query performance tracking is working correctly with mocks.
4. **test_transaction_tracking_basic** - The basic transaction tracking is working correctly with mocks.
5. **test_prepared_statement_reuse** - The prepared statement reuse is working correctly with mocks.

## What Doesn't Work (21 failing tests)

### Bulk Operations Issues

1. **test_bulk_insert_basic** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected 50.
2. **test_bulk_update** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected 50.
3. **test_bulk_delete** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected 50.
4. **test_bulk_insert_asyncpg** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected 100.
5. **test_bulk_operations_cross_service** - The mock implementation returns a count of 0 instead of the expected 25.
6. **test_bulk_insert_time_series** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected count.

### Connection Pool Issues

7. **test_connection_pool_basic** - AttributeError in the mock implementation.
8. **test_connection_pool_concurrent** - Issues with concurrent connections in the mock implementation.
9. **test_connection_pool_cross_service** - Issues with cross-service connections in the mock implementation.
10. **test_connection_pool_metrics** - Assertion error in the mock implementation.

### Failure Scenario Issues

11. **test_connection_failure** - SQLAlchemy error in the mock implementation.
12. **test_transaction_rollback** - Assertion error in the mock implementation.
13. **test_prepared_statement_failure** - Issues with prepared statement failure in the mock implementation.
14. **test_bulk_operation_failure** - Assertion error in the mock implementation.
15. **test_asyncpg_connection_failure** - Issues with asyncpg connection failure in the mock implementation.

### Monitoring Issues

16. **test_transaction_tracking** - TypeError in the mock implementation.
17. **test_query_analysis** - AssertionError in the mock implementation.
18. **test_database_health_check** - TypeError in the mock implementation.
19. **test_monitoring_cross_service** - TypeError in the mock implementation.

### Prepared Statement Issues

20. **test_prepared_statement_basic** - The mock implementation returns a count of 1 instead of the expected 10.
21. **test_prepared_statement_asyncpg** - NameError in the mock implementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Bulk Operations Mocks**:
   - Update the mock implementation to return the correct count for bulk operations.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles bulk insert, update, and delete operations.

2. **Fix Connection Pool Mocks**:
   - Fix the AttributeError in the connection pool mock implementation.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles concurrent connections.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles cross-service connections.
   - Fix the metrics in the connection pool mock implementation.

3. **Fix Failure Scenario Mocks**:
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles connection failures.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles transaction rollbacks.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles prepared statement failures.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles bulk operation failures.
   - Ensure that the mock implementation properly handles asyncpg connection failures.

4. **Fix Monitoring Mocks**:
   - Fix the TypeError in the transaction tracking mock implementation.
   - Fix the AssertionError in the query analysis mock implementation.
   - Fix the TypeError in the database health check mock implementation.
   - Fix the TypeError in the monitoring cross-service mock implementation.

5. **Fix Prepared Statement Mocks**:
   - Ensure that the mock implementation returns the correct count for prepared statement operations.
   - Fix the NameError in the prepared statement asyncpg mock implementation.

## Conclusion

The database mocking infrastructure has been significantly improved, but there are still many issues to resolve. The mock implementation now provides more realistic behavior and better handles async operations, but many of the integration tests are still failing due to specific issues with the mock implementation. Further work is needed to make the mock implementation fully compatible with all tests.
