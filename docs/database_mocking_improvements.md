# Database Mocking Infrastructure Improvements

## Summary of Changes

1. **Enhanced MockDatabaseConnectionPool Class**:
   - Added missing attributes and methods
   - Improved mock result objects with realistic return values
   - Added proper asyncpg connection mocking
   - Fixed context managers to properly handle async operations

2. **Improved Mock Functions**:
   - Enhanced `mock_execute_prepared_statement` to return more realistic results based on query type
   - Updated `mock_bulk_insert` to handle return_defaults parameter
   - Added better logging to all mock functions
   - Fixed decorator functions to preserve function attributes

3. **Fixed Path Issues**:
   - Updated `run_benchmarks.py` to use absolute paths
   - Created a fixed version that properly handles paths and includes the --use-mocks option

4. **Created Test Scripts**:
   - Created `test_mock_implementation.py` to test the full mock implementation
   - Created `test_simple_mock.py` for simplified testing of the mock functionality

5. **Updated Test Fixtures**:
   - Fixed the pytest fixtures in `conftest.py` to use our improved mock implementation
   - Ensured proper async context management

## Remaining Issues

1. **Integration Tests**:
   - Some integration tests are still failing with the mock implementation
   - Need to investigate specific test failures and fix the mock implementation accordingly

2. **Decorator Functions**:
   - The track_transaction and track_query_performance decorators need to be fixed to work properly with the mock implementation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Need to improve error handling in the mock implementation to better simulate database errors

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**:
   - Analyze each failing test and update the mock implementation to handle the specific requirements
   - Focus on making the mock implementation more robust for different query types

2. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Add detailed documentation on how to use the mock implementation
   - Include examples of common usage patterns

3. **Add More Test Coverage**:
   - Create additional test cases to ensure the mock implementation works correctly in all scenarios
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

4. **Create a Mock Database Schema**:
   - Implement a simple in-memory database schema for more realistic testing
   - Allow tests to define tables and data that can be queried

## Conclusion

The database mocking infrastructure has been significantly improved, but there are still some issues to resolve. The mock implementation now provides more realistic behavior and better handles async operations, but some integration tests are still failing. Further work is needed to make the mock implementation fully compatible with all tests.
