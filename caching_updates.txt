#### Task 2.2: Implement Caching - 100% Complete
* ✅ Frequently accessed data identified for caching.
* ✅ Caching layer (Redis, in-memory fallback, decorators, factory) implemented in `common-lib` and applied to some read repositories.
* ✅ **Apply Caching to All Remaining Services (Completed)**
    * ✅ Identified all read repositories in Causal, Backtesting, Market, and Coordinator services.
    * ✅ Applied caching decorators to all read methods (get_by_id, get_all, get_by_criteria, etc.) in all repositories.
    * ✅ Used appropriate TTL values for different types of data:
        * get_by_id: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
        * get_all: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
        * get_by_criteria: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
        * get_task_status: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
    * **Guidance & Checklist:**
        * [x] **Strategy Selection:** Implemented read-through caching strategy for all repositories.
        * [x] **Cache Invalidation:** Implemented TTL-based expiration for all cached data.
        * [x] **Data Serialization:** Ensured data stored in the cache is efficiently serialized/deserialized using JSON.
        * [x] **Cache Key Design:** Used consistent cache key naming conventions based on method names and entity types.
        * [x] **Error Handling:** Implemented graceful fallback to direct data access when cache is unavailable.
        * [x] **Testing:** Created comprehensive unit tests for caching logic to verify cache hits, misses, and invalidation.
        * [x] **Performance Monitoring:** Implemented monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios, latency, and eviction rates.
        * [x] **Configuration:** Ensured cache connection details (e.g., Redis URL) are managed via externalized configuration.
* ✅ **Implement Redis Configuration for Production Environments**
    * ✅ Set up and documented production-ready Redis configurations (e.g., clustering, persistence, security).
* ✅ **Test Caching Performance and Invalidation Strategies**
    * ✅ Conducted targeted performance tests to measure latency improvements and validated that invalidation works as expected under various scenarios.
